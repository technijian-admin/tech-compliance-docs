# Technijian Email Generator

## Overview

Generates Technijian-branded HTML email templates, newsletter content, and email signatures. All output is responsive, inline-styled for email client compatibility, and follows the Technijian Brand Guide 2026.

**Keywords**: email, newsletter, email template, email signature, email campaign, marketing email, technijian, html email

## Brand Colors (for inline CSS)

```
Core Orange: #F67D4B    Core Blue: #006DB6     Teal: #1EAAC8
Dark Charcoal: #1A1A2E  Brand Grey: #59595B    Off White: #F8F9FA
Light Grey: #E9ECEF     White: #FFFFFF
```

> **Single source of truth**: `assets/brand-tokens.json` holds the authoritative colors, tagline, logos, phone lines, and addresses. The hex values above are a cached convenience for inline-CSS speed — if anything looks off or you're unsure, read/sync from `brand-tokens.json` rather than trusting a pasted value, because hardcoded copies drift.

> **Tagline**: "technology as a solution" — lowercase, no period. The old **"Technology Support, Your Way."** is RETIRED — never use it in subject lines, body, alt text, or footers.

## HTML Email Rules

### Technical Requirements
- **Max width**: 600px for the email container
- **All CSS must be inline** - no `<style>` blocks (stripped by many email clients)
- **Use tables for layout** - `role="presentation"` on all layout tables
- **Font stack**: `'Open Sans', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Images**: Always include `alt` text and `width` attribute
- **CTA buttons**: Use table-based buttons (not `<a>` with background), for Outlook compatibility:
  ```html
  <table role="presentation" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td style="background-color:#F67D4B;border-radius:6px;">
        <a href="#" style="display:inline-block;padding:12px 24px;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;color:#FFFFFF;text-decoration:none;">Button Text</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

## Email Copy Guidelines

### Subject Lines
- **Communicate value, not hype** ("3 ways to reduce IT downtime" not "AMAZING IT SECRETS!!!")
- **Keep under 50 characters** for mobile preview
- **Never use ALL CAPS** or excessive punctuation
- **Personalize when possible** ("[First Name], your quarterly IT review is ready")

### Body Copy
- **Respect the reader's time** - get to the point
- **One CTA per email section** - don't overwhelm with choices
- **Lead with benefit** - what does the reader gain?
- **Short paragraphs** - 2-3 sentences max per paragraph
- **Clear CTA** - "Schedule a Call" beats "Click Here"; make the contact actionable in the body (949.379.8499 or a real scheduling link)
- **Low-friction on-ramp** - the easiest first "yes" is the free **Nexus Assess** assessment (Network Detective: internal + external vulnerability scan + M365 review). Offer it as the lead CTA in cold/expansion outreach.

### Honesty Discipline (applies to all email copy)
- **No fabricated proof** - never invent metrics, case-study outcomes, customer quotes, or stats. The service is launching, so there are no completed client projects to cite; use anonymized industry profiles (scope/effort only).
- **Dated near-term builds** - frame any not-yet-shipped capability as a dated near-term build, never as already delivered.
- **Estimates are estimates** - flag any number as an estimate to be "confirmed at discovery."

### Newsletter Specific
- **2-3 articles per newsletter** - not more
- **Each article**: Headline + 2-3 sentence summary + "Read More" button
- **Include a "Quick Tips" section** for practical value
- **End with a call-to-action banner** (contact us, schedule a review)

### Verify Before Sending
Never declare an email done unverified. Preview the **rendered** message (not the raw HTML source) at send size and confirm:
- The signature/footer shows the correct phone line (default 949.379.8499) and the current tagline; **no** retired "Technology Support, Your Way." string anywhere.
- All merge fields (`[First Name]`, `[Company]`, dates) are filled — no placeholder leaks.
- Every link resolves and the logo loads with correct alt text.

## Logo for Email

Use the hosted logo URL in all email templates:
```
<!-- Replace with actual hosted URL -->
<img src="https://technijian.com/assets/technijian-logo.png" alt="Technijian - technology as a solution" width="200">
```

## Personal Outreach (Ravi's voice) — CTA Closing Pattern

**This section governs personal outreach emails (cold and warm-expansion), NOT marketing newsletters or announcements.** Newsletter/announcement templates above are unaffected.

**Encoded after Algro International, 2026-05-28.** When Ravi sends a personal outreach email (biz-dev intro, blueprint follow-up, expansion to an existing client), the closing CTA must:

1. **Route to the Book-a-Meeting button in his signature**, not "reply with a date." The signature already has the button — one click books a slot, zero round-trips.
2. **Broaden the meeting topic beyond the single client** so it positions Ravi as a cross-client strategist with broader thought leadership.

### Default closing template

> *"I'd love [N] minutes to walk you through it. Use book a meeting in my signature line to setup a time to discuss this and all the [AI Strategies / managed IT / cybersecurity / hosting / topic-relevant work] Technijian is putting into place for itself and its clients."*

Adapt the bracketed clause to match the topic of the email body. Always use lowercase "book a meeting" — Ravi writes it conversationally, not as a proper noun.

### Reference

This is enforced in the global `send-email` skill at `~/.claude/skills/send-email/SKILL.md` (CTA Closing Pattern section). It is also enforced in `technijian-biz-dev-blueprint/SKILL.md` (Phase 11) for outreach following a generated blueprint deliverable.
